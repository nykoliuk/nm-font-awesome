Wordpress plugin that adds the latest version 5 of Font Awesome into your WordPress project.

== Description ==

NM Font Awersome makes it easy to add vector icons and social logos from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to your website. And version 5 is redesigned and built from the ground up!

= Usage =
Font Awesome version 5 icons can be any of 4 different styles, each with its own prefix.
In the free version of the plugin, you can use only 2 styles:
* **Solid**, with style prefix `fas`
* **Brands**, with style prefix `fab`

Read the documentation [Additional Styling Classes](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/svg-with-js#additional-styling) to use the plug-in's features 100%.

**NM Font Awersome gives you 2 ways of usage:**
#### 1) SHORTCODE
`[nm_fa name="fas fa-camera-retro"]`

`[nm_fa name="fas fa-camera-retro fa-2x"]`

`[nm_fa name="fas fa-cog fa-spin"]`

Where the name is the name of the class of the icon that you want to add.

A complete list of icons you can find on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

#### 2) TINYMCE
Select the desired icon in the drop-down menu.

#### 3) HTML
To access the HTML editor, click on the "HTML" link on the tab at the top right of the text editor window in WordPress.<br /> If you don\'t know how to use Font Awesome in HTML, you can read [Font Awesome Basic Use](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/svg-with-js#basic-use).

**Coming soon**

In the near future there will be a PRO version, where you can use all Awesome Icons.
